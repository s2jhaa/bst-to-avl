# bst-to-avl
In the given method signatures, there were few things which i couldn't understand properly and the comments provided were also limited so, i did few required changes in the method signatures.
In the main file inside of BST folder, there's a program(main.cpp) for the Right Threaded Binary Search Tree, along with the function for destructCode (Clearing tree) and printTree (displays the tree data).

Whereas, in the AVL folder, there's program (main.cpp) for the conversion of Right threaded binary search tree into an AVl tree. 

NOTE : Don't call Show Balanced Tree unless you have converted it.
